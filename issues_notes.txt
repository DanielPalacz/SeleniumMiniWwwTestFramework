# Issues with sending long text by Selenium "send_keys"
# https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium-google-code-issue-archive/issues/3732
#
# Selenium performance is restricted by requirement to emulate user behaviour.
# That's the reason why it types the text "key by key".
# If you want to overcome this restriction you have two options:
# 1) Pasting the text from the clipboard (for local use only)
# 2) Executing JavaScript that directly assigns value of the target element
# JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor ) driver;
# js.executeScript("arguments[0].value='"+longText+"'", element);
